# starting from 2 because it's the first prime number
# time complexity for this block of code is O(sqrt(n)log(n)) iirc
# since the question is to find the largest prime factor of the given number
# it is clear that the largest prime factor is less than sqrt(n)
# so i find all the prime numbers below sqrt(n) and then loop thro them to find
# all prime numbers which are factors of n and i use the max() func to find the max of it

# for i in range(2, 3):
#     for j in range(i+i, int(sqrt(number+1)), i):
#         primes.discard(j)
#         primes.discard(i//j)
# i can take this a step further as 2 in the only prime number and other prime numbers are odd
# compute this for 2 separately and continue with 3 and all other odd numebers i can start with 3 and increment by 2 which will always be odd
# for i in range(3, int(sqrt(number+1)), 2):
#     for j in range(i+i, int(sqrt(number+1)), i):
#         primes.discard(j)
#         primes.discard(i//j)

# since set doesn't remember the order i inserted the items in
# it necessary to sort them first

# for i in list(primes)[::-1]:
# for i in list(primes):
# if number % i == 0:
# print(i)
